# github-final-project - Simple Interest Calculator 

## Overview

This project is a simple calculator that computes the simple interest given the principal amount, the annual rate of interest, and the time period in years.

## Features

- Calculates simple interest based on user input.
- Takes into account:
  - Principal amount (`p`)
  - Time period in years (`t`)
  - Annual rate of interest (`r`)
- Provides the simple interest as the output.

## Formula

The formula used to calculate simple interest is:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = p \times t \times r \]

Where:
- `p` is the principal amount
- `t` is the time period in years
- `r` is the annual rate of interest

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-interest-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd simple-interest-calculator
   ```

### Usage

Run the script to calculate simple interest:

```bash
python simple_interest_calculator.py
```

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the calculator:

```python
# Example inputs
p = 1000  # Principal amount
t = 5     # Time period in years
r = 0.05  # Annual rate of interest (5%)

# Calculating simple interest
simple_interest = p * t * r

# Output
print(f"Simple Interest: {simple_interest}")
```

Output:
```
Simple Interest: 250.0
```
